/**
 * Represents the result of an operation, following a pattern similar to DialogResult in C#.
 * 
 * This enum allows consistent handling of operation outcomes such as success, cancellation,
 * or unexpected/invalid states. It is commonly used to simplify flow control in response to user actions
 * or system events throughout the IDE.
 *
 * Usage examples:
 * <pre>
 * DialogResult result = saveFile();
 * if (result == DialogResult.OK) {
 *     // proceed
 * } else if (result == DialogResult.ABORT) {
 *     // handle cancellation
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Enum values:
 * - {@code OK}: The operation completed successfully.
 * - {@code NULL}: The result is undefined or invalid; must be handled properly to avoid null behavior.
 * - {@code ABORT}: The operation was canceled intentionally (e.g., by the user).
